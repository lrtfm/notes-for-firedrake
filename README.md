# Firedrake Notes

```{raw} latex
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}

```

Firedrake is a high-level computational framework for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method.  When I learn how
to use Firedrake, I took some notes on it, including installation, mesh
generation, defining variational forms, solving PDEs, and some tricks on using
Firedrake. 

The notes are currently being consistently updated and are far from being a comprehensive document.
