# Firedrake Notes

Firedrake is a high-level computational framework for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs) using the finite element method.  When I learn how
to use Firedrake, I took some notes on it, including installation, mesh
generation, defining variational forms, solving PDEs, and some tricks on using
Firedrake.
